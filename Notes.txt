REST API

Client Server seperation:
    - client can only make requests for the server
    - server handles the requests and gives appropriate information back, either account info with history
        , processed video or public clips.


Uniform Interface:
    - Standerdise requests and responses from clients and servers, use http:

        GET: To retrieve a resource.

        POST: To create a new resource.

        PUT: To edit or update an existing resource.

        DELETE: To delete a resource.

Stateless:
    - We don't require the server to remember anything and each task is seperate such that any thread can pick
      up any task.

Caching:
    - We can have caching occur on local devices such that when they open the app they don't need to make a request
      everytime.

server:

    - take json
